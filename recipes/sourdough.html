    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sourdough can be defined as an intermediate product containing a flour/water mixture that has been fermented by a combination of bacteria, usually heterofermentative strains of lactic acid bacteria and yeast (DeVuyst and Neysens, 2005), resulting in an end product with a sour taste.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150g bubbly, active sourdough starter</li>
        <li>250g/ 8.80 oz warm water, preferably filtered*</li>
        <li>25g/ .90 oz olive oil</li>
        <li>500g/ 17.65 oz bread flour (not all purpose flour)</li>
        <li>10g/ .4 oz fine sea salt</li>
        <li>fine ground cornmeal, for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the Dough: This is simply a matter of combining water, sourdough starter, salt and flour in bowl, and stirring to form a sticky dough ball</li>
        <li>Bulk Fermentation: This is just a fancy name for the first rise. During the first two hours of the bulk fermentation, you’ll perform a series of stretches and folds, which will give the dough strength and elasticity.</li>
        <li>Shape + Bench Rest: This step ends the bulk fermentation. You’ll shape the dough, let it rest, then shape it once more.</li>
        <li>Proofing the Dough: In this recipe, you’ll cold proof the dough in the fridge, ideally for 24 to 48 hours, though you can get away with a shorter proof.</li>
        <li>Scoring + Baking the Dough: After the dough has proofed, you’ll turn it out onto a piece of parchment paper, score it; then transfer it to a preheated baking vessel.</li>
    </ol>
